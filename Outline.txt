1. Enter Publisher ID into Indeed API
2. Search for ALL applicable Python jobs in the area and collect the results
3. Extract the job IDs from all of those results
4. Use the job IDs to connect to Indeed API and get 'snippet' for each job, collect those together
5. Scrape those job snippets to make each word into an entry in a list
6. Remove special characters
7. Make everything lowercase
8. Remove stopwords and common terms
9. Form a set of each list to remove duplicate words
10. Count how many total job listings were scraped
11. Find the frequency of the terms in those listings (# listings where term appears/# of total listings)

Possibly do some data munging by combining like terms (consider C and C++ the same thing? Or TDD and test-driven design.  Things like that).
